# The kyuji data has been combined from these sources: 常用漢字表・新字源［改訂新版］・新漢語林［第二版］・全訳漢字海［第四版］・新字源［改訂新版］・字通［普及版］・常用解字［第二版］・人名字解. The simplification patterns have then been applied to all characters in the JIS/漢検 range.		
# *¹ Overlapping characters. These characters with different meaning and usage were merged into one and thus cannot be accurately reverted back to their original forms. 予余台弁欠缶芸.		
# *² Novel simplification pattern introduced by the 表外漢字字体表. These characters (曻𱀧) are not mentionned but follow the same simplification patterns. 桝沪曻𱀧.		
# *³ 表外漢字だけに適用されるデザイン差. These are considered as design variations by the 表外漢字字体表 (not 新字). In reality any kanji dictionary will tell you that the relation is not a design variation but rather a 俗字. These characters (荆靭頹臈) are considered as design variations but the relation is actually the opposite thus the relation has been fixed. These characters (仭刄劔釼㫖秃𮋝𮌖册删姗) are not mentionned but have been extrapolated based on the variation patterns. 叱呑荆靭頹臈𥡴栅仭刄劔釼㫖秃𮋝𮌖册删姗.		
# *⁴ 人名用漢字. Depending on the source, 新字 forms that are 人名用漢字 are either consider as the de-facto standard (even though the scope of the 人名用漢字表 is strictly names) with the 旧字 listed as 旧字/異体字 or the opposite, the 旧字 form will be properly recorded as the main form with the 新字 being a 俗字. Of course, this ambiguity is only present in post-kanji reform sources. Two new simplification method not seen in the 常用漢字 are introduced (兎晋). These 人名用漢字 (亘凛桧熙祢祷) are not directly stated as being 新字 by most sources but follow the same simplification patterns. In addition, these simplified forms (芦祷) are both 人名用漢字 and 簡易慣用字体.		
# Non-destructive overlapping characters. These characters were also merged into one but do not have any recorded use within words and thus can be replaced without issue. 万体党医担浜灯糸胆虫蚕豊岳証亘.		
# These 旧字 are etymologically incorrect or have an irregular shape, refer to the adjacent column for the correct character. See I.Font Project's Inherited Glyph Standardization Documents. 竝倂敍甁餠暜𧭘屛幷俱腁逬騈斅敺.		
# Unsimplified 常用漢字. In addition to pre-existing inconsistencies, the 2010 常用漢字表 revision's additional characters largely adopted 旧字 forms instead of 新字. This means that the potential 新字 is thus a 拡張新字体. 剝塡籠頰虎卒箋脇濁協毀彙喩懸璽.		
# Unsimplified 人名用漢字. The 人名用漢字表 contains the 旧字 without adopting the corresponding 新字 as well. For these characters (繡蔣蠟醬鷗) the 新字 is part of the 簡易慣用字体. 繡蔣蠟醬鷗俠俱摑焰簞繫萊蟬顚爾廳淵稟翠轟篠徠勁犀秦傳寵驍.		
# These characters are 国字 and thus cannot strictly be considered as a 拡張新字体. However they use a simplified shape as one of their components and thus have been included. In once instance the corresponding 旧字 is an already existing character with a different meaning (枠) thus causing a merge. 枠栃䋆蟵.		
# Characters like 刑 and 邢 are not written originally as 幵 because they are derived from 井 and not from 干+干.		
# 並, the 旧字 is widely documented as being 竝 but it is in fact a 本字. All other characters containing the 竝 component are documented as being 本字 and not 旧字. 普/譜 have been forcefully added to the document for consistency.		
# 疊, the 常用漢字表 records the 新字 as being 畳 but this is an unusual simplification method as three identical stacked components should be simplified to 疂 instead of deleting two components. See 塁摂渋. 疂 has been included as a 拡張新字体.		
# 窓, the 旧字 should be 窻 as it follows the same simplification method of 悤 becoming 忩 (the upper part of 窓 is not 穴 but 宀+八, see 総聡) but is not recorded as such by any source. 窻 is instead recorded as 別体 even though it is etymologically and historically the correct forms. To be more precise, the 正字 is actually 窗. 窗 became corrupted as 窻 which then became corrupted as 窓.		
# 刹, the 旧字 should be 剎 as it follows the same simplification method of 𣏂 becoming 杀(殺-the 旧字 is not recorded in this document as the it doesn't exist in the unicode standard) but is not recorded as such by any source. 剎 is instead recorded as 別体 even though it is etymologically and historically the correct forms.		
# 兎, is either recorded as the 俗字/新字 of 兔 or as de-facto standard form because it is a 人名用漢字. Only 新漢語林 records it as a 新字. This simplification method is novel and not present in the 常用漢字表.		
# 亘, originally 亘(めぐる・もとめる・のべる) and 亙(わたる・つらなる・あまねし) are two distinct characters but 亙 has been corrupted to 亘 (identical to the corruption of 恒), then the original meaning of 亘 has disappeared. This character is not recorded anywhere as a 旧字 but should be.		
# 冊, sometimes recorded as the 新字 of 册 (全訳漢辞海・漢字源・字通) but it is not. It is just an alternate form (the 表外漢字字体表 agrees over this, as any pre-war dictionary).		
# 婿, is only recorded as being the 新字 of 壻 by the 新漢語林. The etymologically correct form is indeed 壻, as any pre-war dictionary will tell you.		
# 強, sometimes recorded as being the 新字 of 强 but this is incorrect, 强 is just an alternate form.		
# 翻, listed as having 飜 as 旧字(所謂康煕字典体) in the 常用漢字表 but that information is incorrect as it is in fact just an 異体字 and is recorded as such in all kanji dictionaries and thus was not included in this list.		
# 致, some sources may not correctly cite 𦤶 as the 旧字 due to the slight shape difference and its rarity in encoding standards (not recorded in JIS, Unicode extension B).		
# 衛, only the 新字源 considers 衞 as being the 本字 instead of the 旧字.		
# 褒, is only considered the 新字 of 襃 by the 新漢語林, the 字通 and the 常用漢字表. Other sources cite it as being either a 本字 or an unspecified 異体字. Of course, any pre-war dictionary will have 襃 as being the correct form. 		
# 覇, is only considered the 新字 of 霸 by the 漢字源, 字通 and the 常用漢字表. Other sources list it as either 本字/正字 or unspecified 異体字. Once again pre-war dictionary all have 霸 as the correct form.		
# 闘, the only source citing 鬭 as being the 旧字体 of 闘 is the 常用漢字表, all other sources cite 鬪 as being the 旧字 and 鬭 as being the 正字. The original 当用漢字表 of 1946 lists 鬪 without any associated 旧字. https://www.bunka.go.jp/kokugo_nihongo/sisaku/joho/joho/kakuki/syusen/tosin02/index.html. Once again, pre-war sources are unanimous on 鬭 being the correct form.		
# 隷, the only source not citing 隸 as the 旧字 is the 字通 that rather cites 隸 as a 異体字. Once again pre-war sources are unanimous as to 隸 being the correct form.		
# 餅, only the 新字源 considers the 旧字 餠 as being a 本字. Which is odd because all other instances of characters containing 𩙿/幷 are properly recorded as 旧字 by the same dictionary.		
# 拝, the 旧字体 (拜) is somewhat irregular as the shape of the 扌 changes for aesthetical reasons .
